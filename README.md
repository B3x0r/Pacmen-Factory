# Pacmen-Factory
 
#### Description:
Press a button to add PacMen to the screen and watch them bounce around after pressing the "Start Game" button. The PacMen even change directions and chomp.

#### Installation:

You can just copy the files into a folder on your device. Then, you drag the .html file and it into the url line. Then, hit the "Add Pacman" button as many times as you would like. Then, click the "Start Game" button. Then, you can watch Pacman chop across the screen, hit the edge, come back, and repeat...until you are bored.
 
#### Usage:
 
For now, it is just a fun to watch a bunch of PacMen without ***Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde***.
 
#### Support: 
 
I don't foresee anyone having trouble with this one right now.
 
#### Roadmap: 
 
I would love to create fruit for PacMan to eat. Or maybe add a bow to make **Ms.** PacMan.
